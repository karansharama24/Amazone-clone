# Amazon Clone - HTML Structure

This project is a basic HTML clone of the Amazon.com website, focusing on the layout structure.

##  Description

This project replicates the primary layout of the Amazon homepage using HTML. It includes the header, navigation, hero section, shop sections, and footer. It's designed to demonstrate HTML structure and does not include full functionality or dynamic content.

##  HTML Structure

The HTML is organized into the following main sections:

* **Header:**
    * `navbar`: Contains the logo, address, search bar, sign-in/accounts, returns & orders, and cart sections.
    * `panel`:  Includes the "All" menu, navigation options (Today's Deals, Customer Service, etc.), and deals information.
* **Hero Section:**
    * Displays a message about shopping on Amazon.com and a link to Amazon India.
* **Shop Section:**
    * Contains boxes representing different product categories. Each box includes a title, image, and "see more" link.
* **Footer:**
    * `foot-panel1`: "Back to Top" button.
    * `foot-panel2`:  Links to "Get to Know Us", "Make Money with Us", "Amazon Payment Products", and "Let Us Help You" sections.
    * `foot-panel3`: Amazon logo.
    * `foot-panel4`:  Links to "Conditions of Use", "Privacy Notice", "Your Ads Privacy Choices" and copyright information.

##  Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the Amazon clone.
* `style.css`:  (Linked) Contains the CSS styling for the page layout.
* `picofclone/`: (Directory) Contains images used in the shop section boxes.

##  Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS (linked file)
* Font Awesome (for icons)

##  Limitations

* This is a static HTML page. It does not have any dynamic functionality (e.g., search, adding to cart).
* The CSS file (`style.css`) is required for the page to render correctly.
* Images in the `picofclone/` directory are necessary for the shop sections to display correctly.
